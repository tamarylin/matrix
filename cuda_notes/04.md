gird -> block -> thread

- predefined variables  : indexed `0-(N-1)` 
- blocks are arranged in `1D` inside grid and so are threads in block

- the organization of grids and block is decided during kernel launch
- the parameters are each `dim3` : `struct unsigned int x, y, z`

```C
// intiliaze execution config parameters
dim3 dimGrid(128,1,1);
dim3 dimBlock(32,1,1);
// 
KernelFunction<<<dimGrid, dimBlock>>>(...);
```

- if the grid block and thread block are `1D` , then scalar vectors can also be directly used to launch config 


```C
blockIdx.x = [0,gridDim.x];
blockIdx.y = [0,gridDim.y];
```
